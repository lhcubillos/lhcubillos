# Hi, I'm Luis ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a Robotics Ph.D. candidate in the [Chestek Lab](https://chestekresearch.engin.umich.edu/) at University of Michigan. I did my undergrad in Chile, majoring in robotics and computer science, and enjoy working on projects that can improve people's lives through robotics.

## I'm currently working on:
1. _A deep-learning-augmented Kalman filter for high-performance intracortical decoding_
2. _Compression or noise reduction: the role of dimensionality reduction methods in understanding the brain-muscle relationship_
